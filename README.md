## **About the Game**

Knight & Samurai: Pet Quest is a **2D platformer** developed during the **Durjam** hackathon. Inspired by classic platformers like Mario and Castlevania, we've adapted the concept to a more structured, Terraria-style game in terms of combat and visual style. The game challenges players to navigate perilous levels, defeat villains, and overcome obstacles to reunite the Knight and the Samurai with their lost pets.

The game begins with individual prologues for both the Knight and the Samurai, detailing how they lost their pet cat and panda, respectively, during a global storm. After these introductory stories, players embark on a quest through four distinct levels. For the Knight, the mission involves collecting all tuna cans in each level to open the portal to the next, while also eliminating enemies that threaten his feline companion. Similarly, the Samurai must gather bamboo sticks scattered throughout the levels to unlock portals and defeat skeleton enemies. The adventure culminates in a concluding scene where the characters are joyfully reunited with their pets, symbolizing the enduring effort one must endure to keep loved ones safe.

### **Key Highlights:**

* **Dual Protagonists:** Play as both a Knight and a Samurai, each with unique objectives and enemies.  
* **Classic Platforming with a Twist:** Combines nostalgic platformer mechanics with structured combat and exploration.  
* **Narrative-Driven Levels:** Progress through levels tied to the emotional journey of rescuing beloved pets.

## **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you can run Knight & Samurai: Pet Quest, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Game Engine:** [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (version used during development was new to the team, so likely a recent stable release at the time of the hackathon)

### **Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/AMuh2020/amal_carole

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   cd your-game-repo

3. **Open the project in Godot Engine:** Launch Godot Engine and open the project.godot file located in the cloned repository.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Game Engine:** [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)  
* **Programming Language(s):** GDScript (Godot's scripting language)  
* **Art/Asset Creation Tools:** Pixel art pieces created by team member Amal. Sprites and character frames sourced from [itch.io](https://itch.io/).  
* **Audio/Sound Tools:** Sound effects and background music sourced from various websites.  
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## **Challenges We Ran Into**

Developing Knight & Samurai: Pet Quest presented several challenges, primarily due to our team's newness to the Godot engine. Combining various YouTube video implementations for core functionalities often led to compatibility issues. While we gained enough knowledge to implement some features independently, these self-written Godot code snippets didn't always adhere to best practices, leading to potential issues down the line and some during development.

## **Accomplishments We're Proud Of**

* **Amal:** I'm proud of our team's cohesive collaboration in creating this game. I was particularly impressed with my teammate's ability to add the delicate touches that truly brought the game to life, and I felt our diverse skillsets complemented each other well (despite the many GitHub merge conflicts\!). I also discovered a passion for making simple pixel art pieces, many of which are included in the game.  
* **Carole:** I'm proud of my team's ability to quickly grasp Godot and its functions. Although it was a new platform with a familiar yet confusing programming language, we navigated it successfully using various online guides and mutual support.

## **What We Learned**

* **Amal:** I learned about the multiplying effect of teamwork, which allowed us to achieve results that would have taken me 3-4 times longer individually. Different perspectives truly add depth and quality to a final product, something I believe is evident in our game. I also learned about the fascinating concept of state machines and generously employed them for our game characters to ensure discrete, smooth, and well-compartmentalized actions, saving me from the pain of nested if/else hell.

## **What's Next for Knight & Samurai: Pet Quest**

If the game were to be extended, significant portions of the code would need to be rewritten due to the many "hacky patches" made during the intense hackathon development. This experience underscored how quickly complex systems can become unmanageable when not built with the utmost care and adherence to best practices.
